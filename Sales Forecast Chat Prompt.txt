"I'm building a sales forecast model for 2025 using Python. I need to calculate how many leads are needed in my pipeline each month (Jan-Dec) to meet my ARR goal of $2M. Here's my segmentation data with assumptions about revenue, sales cycles, and implementation timing:

default_data = {
    'Segment': ['Small', 'Small-Medium', 'Medium', 'Medium-Large', 'Large', 'Extra Large'],
    'ARR_per_Customer': [31500, 55125, 75700, 246750, 294625, 367500],
    'Implement_Income': [2400, 4200, 14000, 85000, 144375, 240000],
    'Revenue_in_Segment': [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05, 0.05],
    'Days_to_Close': [90, 90, 120, 120, 180, 365],
    'Close_Rate': [0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10],
    'Days_to_Impl': [30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270]
}

PORTFOLIO_SIZES = {
    'Small': 400,
    'Small-Medium': 700,
    'Medium': 1200,
    'Medium-Large': 5000,
    'Large': 7500,
    'Extra Large': 10000
}

Key requirements:
1. Calculate monthly ARR and revenue considering sales cycles and implementation time
2. Round up to whole numbers for closed deals (no partial deals)
3. Include sales capacity analysis assuming each sales rep can handle 30 leads at a time
4. Show detailed breakdowns by segment and month
5. Account for pipeline turnover based on sales cycles

The goal is to determine:
- Monthly leads, deals, and revenue by segment
- Total ARR and revenue achievement
- Number of sales reps needed
- Sales productivity metrics"

Key Features:

Default target ARR: $2,000,000
Leads per rep: 30

Pipeline Analysis

Pipeline metrics
Monthly lead tracking from January


Monthly Projections
Segment Analysis

Calculations:

Pipeline starts January regardless of segment start dates
Monthly leads based on segment revenue targets and close rates
Open leads accumulate until Days_to_Close period passes
Revenue recognition starts after Days_to_Close + Days_to_Impl

The current codebase implements all core functionality with specific focus on:

Accurate pipeline metrics starting January
Proper target ARR distribution
Responsive revenue calculations based on parameter changes
Clear visualization of portfolio growth"
